# 📅 Earnings Calendar (.ics Generator)

This project automatically generates a `.ics` calendar file containing upcoming earnings release events for U.S.-listed companies, using data from the [Finnhub API](https://finnhub.io/).

The file is updated **twice daily** via GitHub Actions and is compatible with iOS/macOS/Google calendars. Useful for investors who want earnings events directly in their calendar apps.
